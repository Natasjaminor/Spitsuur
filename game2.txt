* this line should be ignored by the program because of the *
* the order should be direction(h,v), length of the car, top-left position and a color 
* if it is the red car.
* first position x,y is 0,0.
* ex: h 2 1 3 r --the red car always horizonal, on y position = y of exit
* ex: v 3 3 5 -- just a normal car
* the first line always will have # followed by the board dimension 3
* ex first line: # 3 -- means a 3x3 board
