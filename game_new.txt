* this line should be ignored by the program because of the *
* the order should be direction(h,v) length of the car top-left position and a color 
* if it is the red car.
* ex: h 2 1 3 r --the red car always horizonal, on y position = y of exit
* ex: v 3 3 5 -- just a normal car
* the first line always will have # followed by the board dimension 3
* ex first line: # 3 -- means a 3x3 board
# 5
h 2 0 2 red
h 3 1 0
v 2 3 2
h 3 2 4
